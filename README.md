The code in this repo represents my notes following [Python GUI and Gaming 101](https://www.udemy.com/pythongui/) course on Udemy.  
There are some practice applications, which I wrote to get a bit more comfortable with certain concepts.  
The numbers do not correspond to the course videos.  They simply show the order of progression.
